# SCDFXIBM TEAM: Spokes For Folks

Using IoT sensors integrated inside a resuable Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) suit, we aim to give first responders the comfort and the care they deserve when responding to a pandemic.

## The Prototype

We used an ESP32 to actuate the sensors. Due to limitations in what materials we had, we could only work with a temparature and humidity sensor.

The programme is able to read temperature and humidity and using the code in Arduino IDE, we are able to send the information to IBM Watson IoT 
Platform where a dashboard is updated.
